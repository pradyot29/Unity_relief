            <div class="content">
                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">California is no stranger to wildfires. In fact, the state has experienced more than 10,000 wildfires in the past year alone. These fires have caused billions of dollars in damage and claimed the lives of dozens of people.
                <ul class="ml-10">
                  <br>

        
                    <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The human cost of California fires is staggering. In addition to the loss of life, fires can also displace families, destroy homes and businesses, and disrupt communities. The psychological impact of wildfires can also be significant, leaving survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health problems.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">One of the most devastating California fires in recent history was the Camp Fire, which broke out in November 2018. The fire quickly spread through the town of Paradise, destroying nearly 19,000 homes and businesses. More than 85 people were killed in the fire, making it the deadliest wildfire in California history.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"> The Camp Fire was a wake-up call for many Californians. It showed how quickly and easily wildfires can spread, and the devastating impact they can have on communities. In the wake of the fire, many Californians have taken steps to mitigate the risk of wildfires, such as clearing brush around their homes and creating defensible space.

                    However, more needs to be done to address the human cost of California fires. The state needs to invest in better fire prevention and suppression measures, and it needs to provide more support for survivors of wildfires. Only then can we begin to reduce the human toll of these devastating events.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">In addition to the loss of life, California fires can also have a significant impact on the economy. The Camp Fire alone caused an estimated $16 billion in damage. This includes the cost of rebuilding homes and businesses, as well as the loss of tourism revenue.

                      The economic impact of wildfires can be felt for years after the event. Businesses may be forced to close permanently, and residents may be unable to return to their homes for months or even years. This can lead to job losses and a decline in property values.

                    </p>
                  
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The human and economic costs of California fires are immense. We need to do more to prevent these fires and to support survivors when they occur. Only then can we begin to mitigate the devastating impact of these events.
