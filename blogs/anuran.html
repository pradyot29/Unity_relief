                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">On Feb. 6, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake occurred in southern Turkey near the northern border of Syria. This quake was followed approximately nine hours later by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake located around 59 miles (95 kilometers) to the southwest.

                  The first earthquake was the most devastating to hit earthquake-prone Turkey in more than 20 years and was as strong as one in 1939, the most powerful recorded there. It was centered near Gaziantep in south-central Turkey, home to thousands of Syrian refugees and the many humanitarian aid organizations also based there.

                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The Turkish government is leading the response there through coordination by AFAD and with the Turkish Red Crescent, however, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and local NGOs form a large part of the Turkey response. State authorities declared a level-4 emergency leading to a call for international assistance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared a three-month state of emergency in 10 of the country’s provinces.

                  Governments around the world were quick to respond to requests for international assistance, deploying rescue teams and offering aid. While countries have offered to support Turkey and funded flash appeals, and the country has disaster management structures to support the response, getting aid to affected Syrians is more difficult. The country of Turkey is recognized in English as Türkiye by the United Nations (UN).

                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">As of March 1, more than 11,000 aftershocks occurred, according to Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD). Aftershocks are expected to continue for the foreseeable future.

                  On Feb. 8, Turkey’s President Erdogan admitted to problems with his government’s initial response amid frustration with the pace of relief and the earthquake’s devastation. Turkey is investigating some contractors, but the entire political and economic system is arguably implicated.
