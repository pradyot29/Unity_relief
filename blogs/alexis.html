              </h3>
                
                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-3 text-xl">On 2 June 2023, three trains collided in the Eastern Indian state of Odisha, killing at least 288 people and injuring over 1,100 passengers – rapidly becoming regarded as one of the world’s worst train disasters in decades.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl xl:text-2xl font-semibold tracking-wide">Reason
                </h3>

                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-3 text-xl">According to officials and witnesses, the train accident occurred within an estimated 10-minute timeframe, located in the midst of farm fields in the Balasore district and resulted in the eruption of shrapnel and personal objects strewn across the tracks.

                  At 6:50pm on 2 June 2023, the Coromandel Express, which operates from Kolkata in West Bengal to Chennai in Tamil Nadu, collided at a speed of 80mph (128km/h) with a suspended freight train.
                  
                  According to South Eastern Railway, at around 7pm, carriages from the freight train then collided with two coaches of the Howrah Superfast Express train, which was heading in the other direction, resulting in the horrific pile-up.
                  
                  As reported by The Guardian, Rajesh Kumar, the senior deputy commercial manager of South Eastern Railway, said “the Coromandel Express had changed tracks, which led to the incident” and that the reason would be investigated.

                <h3 class="text-xl xl:text-2xl font-semibold tracking-wide">Response and rescue efforts
                </h3>
                
                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-3 text-xl">
                  <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The accident was reported as a “deafening sound” and led to nearby residents, who heard the collision, desperately rushing to aid the situation , even using the flashlights on their mobile phones to begin searching for survivors, as reported by CNN.</li>

                  <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The disaster management plan produced by Indian Railways, a statutory body under the Indian Government, emphasised that the immediate focus was on the search and rescue of those affected and to evacuate those likely to be affected by the disaster.</li>
                  
                  <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">Although the people of Oshida united together to face the aftermath of the accident, many families grew distrustful of officials as up to 100 bodies remained unidentified and unclaimed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), as reported by The Independent.</li>
                  
                  <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">On June 5, 2023, the Indian Government, with the assistance of the Odisha Government, made public links to images of the deceased, those admitted to hospitals, and unidentified bodies.
                  
                  Furthermore, the major railway networks across India, including the South Eastern Railway based in Kolkata, responded to the train collision by cancelling over 50 trains in the days following the incident, with further trains diverted and rescheduled.</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl xl:text-2xl font-semibold tracking-wide">An insight into the investigation 
                </h3>
                
                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-3 text-xl">Despite the ongoing investigation and conflicting causes of the accident among many sources, the common blame for the disaster has been on a signalling failure, as stated by Vaishnaw in a report by Sky News.

                  After coming under scrutiny and criticism, which spread across the nation and left citizens pleading for his resignation, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was praised for successfully getting trains moving on the affected tracks alongside noting the accident took place “due to a change in electronic interlocking”, as reported by The Independent.
                  
                  Vaishnaw blamed the tragedy on the electronic interlocking, “a system that manages the tracks and signal sequencing using sensors and feedback”, adding that “whoever did it and how it happened will be found out after proper investigation”.
                  
                  Authorities in India began a formal investigation on Monday 5 June, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) determining whether criminal charges will be levelled.
                  
                  The CBI inquiry became a source of great concern for various authorities, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, who addressed a letter to Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi on Monday 5 June, underlining the urgent need for rail network modernization across the country.
