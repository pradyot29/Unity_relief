                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The recent floods in Delhi have caused widespread damage and displacement, and have raised questions about the city's preparedness for future flooding events.

                  The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy monsoon rains, encroachment on the Yamuna riverbed, and siltation of the river. The Yamuna water level crossed the danger mark of 205.33 meters on several occasions, inundating low-lying areas of the city.
                  
                  The most affected areas included ITO, Mayur Vihar, Kashmere Gate, and the Yamuna floodplains. Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes, and many businesses and schools were closed. The floods also disrupted traffic and caused power outages.
                  
                  The Delhi government has been criticized for its handling of the floods. The government was slow to respond to the crisis, and there was a lack of coordination between different agencies. This led to chaos and confusion, and made it difficult to provide relief to the affected people.
                  
                  The floods have also highlighted the need for better flood management planning in Delhi. The city needs to invest in measures to reduce the risk of flooding, such as dredging the Yamuna river, building flood walls, and relocating people from flood-prone areas.
                  Here is updated information about the deaths and injuries caused by the recent Delhi floods:
                </p>
                <ul class="ml-10">
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">● The official death toll from the floods is 100, but this is likely to rise as more bodies are recovered.</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">● The most common cause of death was drowning, but there were also reports of people being electrocuted, crushed by debris, or killed in landslides.</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">● Many of the victims were children and elderly people</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">● Thousands of people were injured in the floods, and many of them are still receiving treatment in hospitals.</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">● The floods have also caused widespread psychological trauma, and many people are still struggling to cope with the loss of loved ones and the destruction of their homes.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                
                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl" >The floods have had a devastating impact on the people of Delhi, and it will take many years for the city to recover. The government has pledged to provide relief to the affected people, but it is clear that more needs to be done to prevent future flooding events.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="text-xl xl:text-2xl font-semibold tracking-wide">Few fundamental issues that need to be addressed if Delhi has to be spared from routine flooding :</h3>

                <ul class="ml-10">
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"><b>1)</b>The official danger mark for Yamuna River in Delhi is 205.33 M. There are markers sunk in to measure this depth. The point is does the river really enjoy this depth for flow of water in reality? What about the depth reduced due to sedimentation that takes place every year? Even a couple of meters of deposits over the years will reduce the safe water carrying capacity of the river by a huge margin. The river touched the 208.66 M mark in the recent floods. Is it possible that the actual depth available was less by a few meters which led to flooding? It is well known that the need for de-sedimentation receives a lot of lip service but never transcends into action on the ground</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"><b>2)</b> Next, is the strengthening of the river’s embankments on a regular basis and erecting suitable barriers at vulnerable points across the length of the river as it flows across Delhi. There is hardly any evidence of this happening on the ground.</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"><b>3)</b>Related to above is the constant illegal encroachment of the river bed and the unbridled construction that takes place on such land. Apart from restricting the width of the river bed, such areas pose constant danger to people who inhabit them. The Delhi government, traditionally, overlooks encroachmen</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"><b>4)</b> Creating buffer zones along the river banks should be integral to any planning in such matters. Unfortunately, Delhi has no such provisions since we have markets, public places and housing complexes that literally abut the banks in many places. The areas from Majnu Ka Tilla to ISBT and Okhla are prime examples in this regard.</li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"><b>5)</b> Coordination between Delhi and other adjoining states for controlling flow of water in the river is pathetic to say the least. It is no use if the Chief Minister of Delhi approaches Haryana or Punjab governments once the water is already released or about to be released. Such critical issues cannot be dealt with on personal equations or on a day-to-day basis. There must be well considered detailed instructions and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) on what needs to be done in such situations without any special consideration of any particular state. </li>
                    <li class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl"><b>6)</b> States must be self-sufficient in managing their disasters in terms of experts, manpower and other material resources. It is obvious Delhi has hardly any such resource in place. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) can only augment the state efforts. Any expectations that once called, it will manage on its own in totality can only be seen as the state shirking its responsibility. Given their national level commitments, this force cannot be at the beck and call of all states at all times.</li>

                </ul>

                <p class="text-[#5b5963] my-[1rem] mx-0 text-xl">The Delhi state’s elected government must understand that as far as Delhi citizens are concerned, the buck stops at their door step. It is for them to find ways and means to interact and function in tandem with the central and other state governments. This constant bickering and blaming everyone for their failures will not take them or the state anywhere. It goes without saying that any long-term sound plan to avert such disasters will need the cooperation and involvement of other state and central governments as well. The onus of achieving that and ensuring Delhi’s safety will always lie with the local government.
